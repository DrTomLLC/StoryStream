**Impact:** 🟢 LOW - Nice to have, not critical

### Priority 2: Documentation Update (30 minutes)
**Goal:** Update all public documentation

**Tasks:**
- Update README.md with network features
- Update module status tables
- Add network examples to docs

**Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Helps users

### Priority 3: Mobile Development (50+ hours) - FUTURE
**Goal:** Android and Wear OS apps

**Status:** Not started, significant undertaking

   - Copy to your project: `crates/network/src/`
   - Build and test immediately

3. **TUI issues are minor**
   - Core functionality works
   - Tab jumping is cosmetic
   - Can be addressed later

4. **Mobile apps are a major undertaking**
   - 50+ hours of work
   - Not critical for v1.0
   - Desktop/CLI version is fully functional
